Implement an in-memory database that has the following functions. Weâ€™ll be
looking for your code to meet our functionality & performance requirements, be
clear & easy to understand and be resilient to edge cases. Use libraries at
will (but not database-like ones or actual databases). Use Google/Stack
Overflow/online references at will as well. 

The database should be a command line program that reads values from STDIN line
by line and executes the functions as they happen. Please also include a README
explaining how to run your program. 

The name and value will be strings with no spaces in them.. 

Functions: 
`SET [name] [value]`: Sets the name in the database to the given value

`GET [name]`:  Prints the value for the given name. If the value is not in the
database, prints NULL 

`DELETE [name]`: Deletes the value from the database 

`COUNT [value]`: Returns the number of names that have the given value assigned
to them. If that value is not assigned anywhere, prints 0 

`END`: Exits the database 

The database must also support transactions: 

`BEGIN`: Begins a new transaction 

`ROLLBACK`: Rolls back the most recent transaction. If there is no transaction to rollback, prints TRANSACTION NOT FOUND 

`COMMIT` 
Commits all of the open transactions 

Performance Requirements: 
The points in this section are goals for the performance of the solution. 
- Aim for GET, SET, DELETE, and COUNT to all have a runtime of less than O(log n),
  if not better (where n is the number of items in the database). 

- The memory usage of the database shouldn't be doubled for every transaction. Minimum Requirements:
  The points in this section are the minimum requirements that a solution must
  meet in order to be scheduled for a live evaluation of the Tech Assessment.
- The first 3 test cases (that are outlined on the last page of this prompt)
  must pass
- Neither an actual database nor a database library is used 
- The basic commands GET, SET, DELETE, and COUNT are implemented per the spec. They take the correct number of arguments and function properly.

Example#1 
```
>>GET a
NULL 
>>SET a foo
>>SET b foo
>>COUNT foo
2
>>COUNT bar
0
>>DELETE a
>>COUNT foo 1
>>SET b baz
>>COUNT foo
0
>>GETb 
baz 
>>GETB 
NULL 
>>END 
```
Example#2 
```
>>SET a 
foo
>>SET a foo
>>COUNT foo 1
>>GET a
foo 
>>DELETE a
>>GET a
NULL
>>COUNT foo 0
>>END 
```

Example#3 
```
>>BEGIN 
>>SET a foo
>>GETa 
foo 
>>BEGIN 
>>SETabar >>GETa 
bar 
>>SETabaz >>ROLLBACK >>GETa 
foo 
>>ROLLBACK >>GETa 
NULL 
>>END 
```
Example#4 
>>SETafoo >>SETbbaz >>BEGIN 
>>GETa 
foo 
>>SETabar >>COUNTbar 1
>>BEGIN 
>>COUNTbar 1
>>DELETE a >>GETa 
NULL 
>>COUNTbar 0
>>ROLLBACK >>GETa 
bar 
>>COUNTbar 1
>>COMMIT 
>>GETa 
bar 
>>GETb 
baz 
>>END
